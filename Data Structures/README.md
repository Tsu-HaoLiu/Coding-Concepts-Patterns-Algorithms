## Int, Float, string

**Int (Integer)**: An integer is a whole number without a fractional component. It represents a numerical value that can be either positive, negative, or zero. Integers are commonly used for counting, indexing, and performing arithmetic operations.

**Float (Floating-Point Number)**: A floating-point number is a numerical value that can have both an integer and a fractional component. It is used to represent real numbers, including numbers with decimal places. Floating-point numbers are commonly used in scientific calculations, engineering, and other fields where precise decimal representation is required.

**String**: A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Strings are often used to store and manipulate textual data, such as names, sentences, or any other type of textual information. String manipulation is a fundamental operation in programming and is used for tasks like input/output, data formatting, and text processing.

## Arrays

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, such as numbers, strings, or objects, in a linear sequence. Each element in an array is identified by an index, which is a numeric value indicating the position of the element within the array. Arrays are commonly used to group related data together for easier manipulation and access.
